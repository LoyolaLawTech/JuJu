## JuJu - The JUvenile JUstice Sentencing Calculator

JuJu is an under-development tool to help lawyers to advocate
for less restrictive and less expensive sentences in juvenile cases.

The idea for the app came from Josh Perry, executive director of the 
[Louisiana Center for Children's Rights](http://laccr.org) and was created
by students in Loyola College of Law's [Technology and Legal Innovation Clinic]( http://loyolalawtech.org )
during the spring semester of 2014.

An in-progress demo can be found [here](http://loyolalawtech.github.io/JuJu/).
